            <p>Hey Justin Mark,

                I love your UI design work, and I'd like to talk with you about possibility to design our new cryptocurrency startup. We're looking for something clean with a minimalistic look to improve our philosophy.
                
                Feel free to check down below a few examples. We also need brand guidline and some screens for our website. 
                
                Tell me if you okay to work with, i think we should. Have a nice day ☺️
                Devid Justin.
